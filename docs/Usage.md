Before using `shiori`, make sure it has been installed on your system. By default, `shiori` will store its data in directory `$HOME/.local/share/shiori`. If you want to set the data directory to another location, you can set the environment variable `SHIORI_DIR` (`ENV_SHIORI_DIR` when you are before `1.5.0`) to your desired path.

```

### Search syntax
With the `print` command line interface, you can use `-s` flag to submit keywords that will be searched either in url, title, excerpts or cached content.
You may also use `-t` flag to include tags and `-e` flag to exclude tags.


## How to use the Web Interface

To access web interface run `shiori serve` or start Docker container following tutorial above. If you want to use a different port instead of 8080, you can simply run `shiori serve -p <portnumber>`. Once started you can access the web interface in `http://localhost:8080` or `http://localhost:<portnumber>` if you customized it. You will be greeted with login screen like this :

![Login screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/go-shiori/shiori/master/docs/screenshots/01-login.png)

Since this is our first time, we don't have any account registered yet. With that said, we can use the default user to access web interface :

```
username: shiori
password: gopher
```

Once login succeed you will be able to use the web interface. To add the new account, open the settings page and add accounts as needed :

![Options page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/go-shiori/shiori/master/docs/screenshots/04-options.png)

The first new account you add will become the owner and it will deactivate the "shiori:gopher" default user automatically.

When searching for bookmarks, you may use `tag:tagname` to include tags and `-tag:tagname` to exclude tags in the search bar. You can also use tags dialog to do this :

- `Click` on the tag name to include it;
- `Alt + Click` on the tag name to exclude it.


### Adding bookmarks manually

- Within the web application, you can add a new bookmark by following the steps depicted in the screenshots below:

![gs-01](./screenshots/17-gs-add-bookmark.png)
![gs-02](./screenshots/18-gs-add-bookmark.png)
![gs-03](./screenshots/19-gs-add-bookmark.png)

This action will generate a new entry, as illustrated in the final screenshot.

- Following this step, you should proceed to select the __Update Archive__ button in order to initiate the process of creating a local copy of the page.

![gs-05](./screenshots/21-gs-add-bookmark.png)

- At this point, you will be able to observe your downloaded bookmark, which has been successfully stored locally.

## Improved import from Pocket

Shiori offers a [Command Line Interface](https://github.com/go-shiori/shiori/blob/master/docs/Usage.md#using-command-line-interface) with the command `shiori pocket` to import Pocket entries but with this can only import them as links and not as complete entries.

To import your bookmarks from [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/) with the text and images follow these simple steps (based on [Issue 252](https://github.com/go-shiori/shiori/issues/252)):

1. Export your entries from Pocket by visiting https://getpocket.com/export

2. Download [this shell script](https://gist.github.com/fmartingr/88a258bfad47fb00a3ef9d6c38e5699e). [*You need to download this in your docker container or on the device that you are hosting shiori*]. Name it for instance `pocket2shiori.sh`.

   > Tip: checkout the documentation for [opening a console in the docker container](https://github.com/go-shiori/shiori/blob/master/docs/Usage.md#running-docker-container).

3. Execute the shell script.

Here are the commands you need to run:
   ```sh
   wget 'https://gist.githubusercontent.com/fmartingr/88a258bfad47fb00a3ef9d6c38e5699e/raw/a21afb20b56d5383b8b975410e0eb538de02b422/pocket2shiori.sh'
   chmod +x pocket2shiori.sh
   pocket2shiori.sh 'path_to_your/pocket_export.html'
   ```

   > Tip: If youâ€™re using shiori's docker container, ensure that the exported HTML from pocket is accessible inside the docker container.

You should now see `shiori` importing your Pocket entries properly with the text and images.
This is optional, but once the import is complete you can clean up by running:

```sh
rm pocket2shiori.sh 'path_to_your/pocket_export.html'
```

##  Import from Wallabag

1. Export your entries from Wallabag as a json file

2. Install [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/). You will need this installed before running the script.

3. Download the shell script
[here](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Aerex/01499c66f6b36a5d997f97ca1b0ab5b1/raw/bf793515540278fc675c7769be74a77ca8a41e62/wallabag2shiori). Similar to the `pocket2shiori.sh` script if you are shiori is in a docker container you will next to run this script
inside the container.

4. Execute the script. Here are the commands that you can run.

  ```sh
    curl -sSOL
    https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Aerex/01499c66f6b36a5d997f97ca1b0ab5b1/raw/bf793515540278fc675c7769be74a77ca8a41e62/wallabag2shiori'
    chmod +x wallabag2shiori
    ./wallabag2shiori 'path/to/to/wallabag_export_json_file'
  ```
