## Supported

### Using Precompiled Binary

Download the latest version of `shiori` from [the release page](https://github.com/go-shiori/shiori/releases/latest), then put it in your `PATH`.

On Linux or MacOS, you can do it by adding this line to your profile file (either `$HOME/.bash_profile` or `$HOME/.profile`):

```
export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/shiori
```

Note that this will not automatically update your path for the remainder of the session. To do this, you should run:

```
source $HOME/.bash_profile
or
source $HOME/.profile
```

On Windows, you can simply set the `PATH` by using the advanced system settings.

### Building From Source

Shiori uses Go module so make sure you have version of `go >= 1.14.1` installed, then run:

```
go get -u -v github.com/go-shiori/shiori
```

### Using Docker Image

To use Docker image, you can pull the latest automated build from Docker Hub :

```
docker pull ghcr.io/go-shiori/shiori
```

If you want to build the Docker image on your own, Shiori already has its [Dockerfile](https://github.com/go-shiori/shiori/blob/master/Dockerfile), so you can build the Docker image by running :

```
docker build -t shiori .
```

## Community provided

Below this there are other ways to deploy Shiori which are not supported by the team but were provided by the community to help others have a starting point.

### Using Kubernetes manifests

If you're self-hosting with a Kubernetes cluster, here are manifest files that
you can use to deploy Shiori:

`deploy.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: shiori
  labels:
    app: shiori
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: shiori
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: shiori
    spec:
      volumes:
      - name: app
        hostPath:
          path: /path/to/data/dir
      - name: tmp
        emptyDir:
          medium: Memory
      containers:
      - name: shiori
        image: ghcr.io/go-shiori/shiori:latest
        command: ["/usr/bin/shiori", "serve"]
        imagePullPolicy: Always
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
        env:
        - name: SHIORI_DIR
          value: /srv/shiori
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /srv/shiori
          name: app
        - mountPath: /tmp
          name: tmp
```

Here we are using a local directory to persist Shiori's data. You will need
to replace `/path/to/data/dir` with the path to the directory where you want
to keep your data. We are also mounting an `EmptyDir` volume for `/tmp` so
we can successfully generate ebooks.

Since we haven't configured a database in particular,
Shiori will use SQLite. I don't think Postgres or MySQL is worth it for
such an app, but that's up to you. If you decide to use SQLite, I strongly
suggest to keep `replicas` set to 1 since SQLite usually allows at most
one writer to proceed concurrently.

To route requests to your deployment, you will need a `Service` that gets used
by an `Ingress` to handle routing. If you wand to add a path suffix or use a
sub domain, you can do so through the ingress config. We only show the bare
minimum config to get you started.

`service.yaml`

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: shiori
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  selector:
    app: shiori
  ports:
    - port: 8080
      targetPort: 8080
```

This is using a `LoadBalancer` type which gives the most flexibility.

`ingress.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: shiori
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx
  rules:
  - http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: shiori
            port:
              number: 8080
```

## Managed Hosting
